            "Tesla had a number of different wireless power ideas. This extremely short range induction power system was one of the first. He also had an idea to encircle a large area in a large 1-100 km diameter coil to supply the enclosed area with wireless power. Those two methods are two forms of induction. These specific methods have not been replicated but we know induction works. A third method, magnetic resonance, has been replicated for relatively efficient transmission up to around 10 m. That uses parallel spiral coils and the tuning varies with any movements around the coils, so it might not work with the receiver in motion. (His other wireless methods are more mysterious. One involved forming a plasma beam from one point to another—through the upper atmosphere if the receiver is beyond line of sight. And the method that he talked about the most involved transmitting current through the ground. To complicate things a little more, any of these methods could be combined in various way, and energy transmission can be combined with energy harvesting. All these other methods are considered impractical today because no one has replicated them yet. None of this is relevant to this single-wire power transmission with induction receiver, but it's useful to have some idea of what he was trying to do and talking about.)\n",

            "This induction power method eliminates the problem with the other induction power rail concepts patented around the same time, which is the need for switching each transmitter coil to activate it only when the receiver is in proximity. Affiliated New York inventor Mark W. Dewey patented these inferior methods. They required a split-transformer transmitter coil to be placed about every foot (30 cm) along the line, which would be prohibitively expensive. With Tesla's system, induction takes place through the shield by the receiver being in proximity to it. No switching is required to enable and disable each segment as the receiver passes, and the shielded line is much cheaper than a linear array of coils.\n",

All the unused current builds up on the line from cycle to cycle. Tesla patented a resonant single-wire power transmission system in 1897 ([US593138](https://patents.google.com/patent/US593138)). Contemporary research has shown resonant power transmission eliminates transmission losses entirely, which achieves the goal of superconducting (using 10-100 kV, 3-30 kHz) ([Strebkov, Avramenko, Nekrasov](http://ptp.irb.hr/upload/mape/kuca/07_Dmitry_S_Strebkov_SINGLE-WIRE_ELECTRIC_POWER_SYSTEM_FOR_RE.pdf)).\n",

That may be what he contemplated using for this. The formula from his magnifying transmitter patent says ground current standing wave resonance occurs at 925.97 Hz. That might be a way to harness ambient energy. With a receiver circuit instead of a large motor, it probably makes sense to use a higher frequency like the 4-12 kHz he used for ground current transmission. It could probably use any frequency up to around 1 MHz where impedance probably becomes excessive. The capacitors are smaller and cheaper for higher frequencies.\n",

The first is air conduction, which it credits David Edward Hughes for discovering in 1879. Summers misspells Hughes. Hughes never published anything about it, but his findings created a sensation among European scientists. The second process, ground conduction, it notes is confined near the surface, which accurately describes surface wave propagation. Like other inventors affiliated with Tesla (Shoemaker, Ehret, Pickard, etc.), he credits Amos Dolbear for inventing the earth current method (in 1882).

There are three forces in Nature that seems to be identical to a certain extent, namely:—Gravitation, magnetism and static. We know that electricity is the cause of magnetic and static attraction and repulsion. I have noted that some scientists think that gravitation is magnetism. I don't see how this could be, as diamagnetic and para magnetic elements are attracted to the Earth in like manner.\n",

One can only imagine what the electro-static power of attraction of the Earth and air could be if strongly charged with electro-static electricity. The inductive power of the Heavenly bodies, if charged statically might reach across the millions of miles of space which separate them. But when we learn that a sheet of metal placed between a body statically charged and a body uncharged, induction does not take place. But then *the electro-static field could be so great as to act in transverse directions,\n",
            "similar to the pressure of the air*. I would not say that the cause of gravitation was static attraction, but I suggest above as a seemingly better explanation than magnetism. Also the laws of gravitation and gyroscopic action seem to be similar. Electro-static attraction might be partly the cause of the tides. While I believe gravitation is the dominating force that holds the Universe in its rotational path, electro-static power of attraction might be a secondary effect. I only mention above to help start others thinking on the subject, as here lies a promising field for research. \n",

            ">**24—Audio Frequency System.** This method resembles very closely the Hertzian wave signalling as used today, as both sending and receiving stations use an elevated antennae in either system. The audio-frequency system is better known at present as the system of electro-magnetic and electro-static induction. But my experiment and study show that this system and the conductive system described in Art. 22 work on the same principle, as both systems use the natural media for conduction. This is Prof. Dolbear's invention of wireless telegraphy and a close analogy to the conductive system invented by Samuel Morse. […] When the high voltage induced current from the secondary winding goes up the antennae the resistance of the air is broken down and the current travels in every direction from the antennae by conduction in electric waves. When these electric currents travel through the air they will seek the least resistance for return to the ground to complete the circuit, and if an antennae placed in their path according to the laws of conduction a portion of the energy will short circuit through the antennae and telephone receivers to the ground, thus causing the receiver diaphram to vibrate by magnetic action of the currents, and audible sounds are sent out. If instead of using a telegraph key in this system, a switch and telephone system. This will not work as far as the telegraph system. In using an induction coil as a wireless telephone transmitter the vibrator must be screwed down tight or shunted by a wire. But this system is like the first conductive system mentioned in Art. 22, it is limited to the electro-magnetic power of the transmitted currents sent out from the transmitting station. Prof. Dolbear could only send about 2 miles when using very high aerials, with the apparatus he used. But with the apparatus that is in use now, messages can be sent around the world with this system. If vacuum tubes and Alexanderson magnetic amplifier be used to modulate speech, and using high power current and transformer, this system will talk around the world when using an audion cascade amplification for reception. How many believe that an electro-static or electro-magnetic field can be made to reach around the world. It seems to me that conduction is a far better explanation. The above systems were not subject to tuning and the distance covered was small in comparison to the energy used. Scientists were naturally looking for a more efficient and better system. There were many working in this direction.\n",

            ">**25—Work of Hughs.** Probably the future will honor Prof. Hughs as the first inventor of the electro-static system used today. In 1879 he was experimenting with a loose contact microphone close to an induction coil. He noticed that every time the coil was operated a buzzing sound was heard in the telephone receiver. Even if the microphone was several feet away from the coil and no connecting wire used.\n",
            "\n",
            ">This caused considerable excitement at the time, especially among scientists. Prof. Hughs thought that this device detected invisible electric waves going though the air by conduction. But scientists discouraged him, expressing doubts as to the invisible electric waves. So later he succeeded in sending wireless signals quite a distance, but became discouraged and gave up. So doubtless here is a lesson for scientists not to discourage any new ideas or theories if even at the time they seem an impossibility. If science had encouraged and helped Prof. Hughs we would have been living in a different would today. \n",

Musk is also now doing the same and alludes to it very esoterically at the end of this [video.](https://youtu.be/9vsj8lznZG0). I've also now discovered it. Neuralink is his initial scaffolding to the eventual goal of providing this to general populace artificially, but it is only meant to be obtained organically.

It is only when your spirit is congruous and consequently pure that you are meant to find it, else you cannot handle it, like an in built fail safe. This is what the ancients referred to as opening your minds eye, becoming a god or what elon here refers to as the vector. In reality we are a biological quantum computer capable of infinite computational power, able to navigate reality itself with theoretical 100% accuracy (see:noise) and conscuously control all of our organic systems. Every piece of data we sense since the day we're born is stored quantumly in our biology. Tesla was aware and seems to have mastered it, attuning his senses to perfection and having dominion over his entire being. This is the power of instinct. The calculative accuracy depends on noise in the system... needs must tune into and become resonant with the source frequency. I believe only autistic people are meant to access it, but elon will change this with grave consequence.

            "NEW elon: I am a senior at Elon majoring in Finance. The program is good and the curriculum is very detailed and heavy. If you're really passionate about finance and would like to know more I would shoot an email to one of the finance professors and maybe even ask for a phone call. I am sure they would be more than happy to talk specifics about the program. I have already gotten a lot of interviews with very decent pay so I am without a doubt going to have a job before I graduate. The other great thing about Elon is its job network and professional development program. 0.9727\n",

            "NEW elon: Please do not send your son to this pitiful excuse for a university. The students share the same mental deficiencies and backwards thinking as the professors. Not only are the students unintelligent and poorly informed about world issues, they are arrogant, rude, callous and obnoxious towards anyone who does not enjoy drinking themselves into a stupor everyday of the week or attending mind numbing social gatherings with conversation that would make the great scholars of generations past weep at the depravity of modern college students. Many students here end up feeling depressed and desperate due to geographic and social isolation or wish to transfer. Professors do not value critical thinking and typically use the classroom as an echo chamber to validate their ideas. The work is not challenging and will leave your child with less stimulation than a monotone middle school science lecture on the lifecycle of grass. Furthermore, Elon is notorious for bleeding parents dry for funds and does not offer much financial aid. Trust me, you will regret it. Do not be fooled by the aesthetics or pristine tour. This school is not what it seems. Peel back the layers and take a closer look.  Run! -0.9393\n",
