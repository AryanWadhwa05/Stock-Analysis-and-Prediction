            "Tesla had a number of different wireless power ideas. This extremely short range induction power system was one of the first. He also had an idea to encircle a large area in a large 1-100 km diameter coil to supply the enclosed area with wireless power. Those two methods are two forms of induction. These specific methods have not been replicated but we know induction works. A third method, magnetic resonance, has been replicated for relatively efficient transmission up to around 10 m. That uses parallel spiral coils and the tuning varies with any movements around the coils, so it might not work with the receiver in motion. (His other wireless methods are more mysterious. One involved forming a plasma beam from one point to another—through the upper atmosphere if the receiver is beyond line of sight. And the method that he talked about the most involved transmitting current through the ground. To complicate things a little more, any of these methods could be combined in various way, and energy transmission can be combined with energy harvesting. All these other methods are considered impractical today because no one has replicated them yet. None of this is relevant to this single-wire power transmission with induction receiver, but it's useful to have some idea of what he was trying to do and talking about.)\n",

Affiliated New York inventor Mark W. Dewey patented these inferior methods. They required a split-transformer transmitter coil to be placed about every foot (30 cm) along the line, which would be prohibitively expensive. With Tesla's system, induction takes place through the shield by the receiver being in proximity to it. No switching is required to enable and disable each segment as the receiver passes, and the shielded line is much cheaper than a linear array of coils.\n",

All the unused current builds up on the line from cycle to cycle. Tesla patented a resonant single-wire power transmission system in 1897 ([US593138](https://patents.google.com/patent/US593138)). Contemporary research has shown resonant power transmission eliminates transmission losses entirely, which achieves the goal of superconducting (using 10-100 kV, 3-30 kHz) ([Strebkov, Avramenko, Nekrasov](http://ptp.irb.hr/upload/mape/kuca/07_Dmitry_S_Strebkov_SINGLE-WIRE_ELECTRIC_POWER_SYSTEM_FOR_RE.pdf)).\n",

That may be what he contemplated using for this. The formula from his magnifying transmitter patent says ground current standing wave resonance occurs at 925.97 Hz. That might be a way to harness ambient energy. With a receiver circuit instead of a large motor, it probably makes sense to use a higher frequency like the 4-12 kHz he used for ground current transmission. It could probably use any frequency up to around 1 MHz where impedance probably becomes excessive. The capacitors are smaller and cheaper for higher frequencies.\n",

            "NEW tesla: I was looking at a chart of the EM spectrum, something I haven't done in years, trying to place exactly where radio waves fell b/c it wasn't clear in my head. In the process, I found references to the longest possible wavelength of light, being the length of the observable universe. Since different frequencies of light affect matter differently, I was struck with the idea that this Universe-length frequency, which would be so low I don't even know how you'd label it, might interact with matter in the form that we call gravity. Unbelievably-long wavelengths of light, stretching across the entire universe. I'm obviously no physics experts, just a guy sitting in  chair, and this just made me wonder.

What makes it interesting is that the theories are Tesla's, and they're explained here in more detail than I've ever seen anywhere else. You can tell it's Tesla's by comparing it to Tesla's statements. The word choices used throughout the text are notably identical to Tesla's. It includes an explanation of Tesla's one-wire power transmission system with details that indicate the author had personal insight into Tesla's work. It mentions Tesla a few times, calling him the Father of Wireless.\n",

            "Tesla said he visited Hertz in 1891 to explain an important error, but he never said exactly what it was. This book explains Hertz's error in a specific experiment and its implications for electrodynamics. To summarize, it says radio transmission takes place by two simultaneous processes. The first is air conduction, which it credits David Edward Hughes for discovering in 1879. Summers misspells Hughes. Hughes never published anything about it, but his findings created a sensation among European scientists. The second process, ground conduction, it notes is confined near the surface, which accurately describes surface wave propagation. Like other inventors affiliated with Tesla (Shoemaker, Ehret, Pickard, etc.), he credits Amos Dolbear for inventing the earth current method (in 1882). The two methods always occur together to some extent because the air conduction wave will generate surface current when the surface wave was not produced simultaneously with the air conduction wave, and vice versa.\n",

            "It contains a theory of geomagnetism with earth having a diamagnetic core in which geomagnetism is produced by thermoelectric earth current. This explains declination and the diffuse shape of the field. It contains a short consideration of an ~~electromagnetic~~ electrostatic (electrodynamic) theory of gravity. It posits a non-Newtonian theory of gravity being an electrostatic wave of sufficient strength and isotropy to be unable to be shielded like normal electromagnetic waves, which are much weaker. It contains a non-Maxwellian theory of light as electrostatic conduction rather than Maxwell's radiation. \n",

It explains how soil can be used as the electrolyte for batteries with \"good results,\" but it doesn't provide figures. It mentions in passing the theory that atmospheric heat is a function of the density of the atmosphere, which is an idea that appears in other works influenced by Tesla. It might suggest a theory that the sun is a positive electrode reflector charged by other cosmic positive electrode reflectors, but it's only as a parenthetical statement so it's not entirely clear that's what he meant (p. 147). \n",
